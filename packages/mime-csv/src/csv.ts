/**
 * Creates a CSV parser.
 *
 * The generated task converts a feed of CSV documents into a feed of records, one {@link Record} per data row, so that
 * a consumer works on structured data rather than on text.
 *
 * A document is given either as text or as a response carrying it as its body, and is read on its own, header row
 * included. A response carrying no body contributes no record.
 *
 * Response bodies are decoded as the `charset` parameter of the content type states, and as UTF-8 where it states
 * none, whatever the US-ASCII default carried by the `text` media types, as UTF-8 is what CSV is exchanged under in
 * practice. A byte order mark opening a document is stripped, both from text and from a body decoded under a Unicode
 * charset.
 *
 * A response stating a content type other than `text/csv` or `application/csv`, or a charset the platform doesn't
 * decode, is reported to the log and read all the same, the body decoded as UTF-8 where the charset is not known, so
 * that a mis-declared source is diagnosed without being shut out: CSV is served under `text/plain` and vendor types
 * as readily as under `text/csv`.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * >
 * > - **Incremental**: each record is emitted as soon as it is parsed, so the feed produced runs dry as the feed drawn
 * >   from does and an endless source is read as long as it is consumed.
 * > - **Streaming**: documents are drawn one at a time and a response body is pulled as records are asked for, so
 * >   resources of any size are handled without holding them in memory and a consumer that stops early releases the
 * >   source; a document given as text is nonetheless parsed in one go, and some of a body is read ahead of the
 * >   records actually consumed.
 * > - **Stateless**: every document is parsed on its own, reading a header row of its own, so the outcome is
 * >   unaffected by how the feed is split across nested feeds or runs.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * >
 * > Records that cannot be parsed are skipped and reported to the log, leaving the feed to run to completion.
 *
 * @typeParam R The type of the records produced; field values are emitted as parsed, without being validated
 *              against it
 *
 * @param options The parsing options
 * @param options.header Reads the first row as column labels, keying records by label rather than by positional
 *                       index; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.skip Ignores lines carrying no content, whether empty or stating delimiters alone, rather than
 *                     emitting them as records; a row carrying at least one field value is kept, however many of the
 *                     others are blank; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.trim Strips surrounding whitespace from field values and column labels alike, quoted values
 *                     included, keying a field left blank once trimmed to `undefined` rather than to an empty string;
 *                     defaults to `false`
 * @param options.flex Emits records whose field count doesn't match the header, leaving out missing fields and
 *                     discarding fields beyond the header, rather than skipping them; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.quote The character wrapping field values; defaults to `"` if unset or empty
 * @param options.delimiter The character separating fields; defaults to `,` if unset or empty
 *
 * @returns A task converting a feed of CSV documents, given as text or as responses, into a feed of records
 *
 * @throws {@link !Error Error} While the feed is consumed, whatever the source reports while producing documents, or
 *                              whatever reading the body of a response reports
 *
 * @see {@link https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180 RFC 4180 Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files}
