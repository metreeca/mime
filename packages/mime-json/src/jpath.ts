	/**

	 *
	 * A single selection reaches across the whole target set: the values retrieved from each target are merged into
	 * one list, sparing the caller a loop of its own.
	 *
	 * A path chains steps, each selecting from the values the preceding one selected and written straight after it,
	 * with no separator beyond the leading `.` some steps carry:
	 *
	 * - `$` — the target value itself; allowed only as the leading step, where it may be omitted
	 * - `.property` / `property` — object property
	 * - `['property']` — object property, with JSON string escapes read leniently: an unaccounted escape stands for
	 *   the character it introduces, so `\'` names an apostrophe
	 * - `[0]` — array element by index
	 * - `.*` / `[*]` — every element of an array or every property value of an object
	 *
	 * Arrays are entered only through an index or a wildcard step, so a path reaching the properties of the objects
	 * held by an array must include an explicit `[*]` or `.*` step.
	 *
	 * Only values a JSON document may state are selected: `null` is selected as the value it states, while
	 * `undefined`, which only a value assembled in code carries, is passed over exactly as an absent property is.
	 *
	 * @param path The selection path; an empty path or `$` selects the target values unchanged
	 *
	 * @returns An immutable list of the values selected by `path`, ordered by target and, within each target, in
	 *          document order; empty if `path` selects no value
	 *
	 * @throws {@link !SyntaxError SyntaxError} If `path` is malformed
