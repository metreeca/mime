////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/**
 * Creates a JSON parser.
 *
 * The generated task converts a feed of JSON documents into a feed of values, one value per document, so that a
 * consumer works on structured data rather than on text.
 *
 * A document is given either as text or as a response carrying it as its body, and is parsed on its own. A document
 * holding no text, or only whitespace, contributes no value, as does a response carrying no body.
 *
 * Response bodies are decoded as UTF-8, the only encoding JSON is exchanged under, and bytes that are not valid UTF-8
 * are read as replacement characters.
 *
 * A response stating a content type that is not a JSON one, `application/json` or a `+json` format such as
 * `application/ld+json`, or a charset other than UTF-8, is reported to the log and read all the same, so that a
 * mis-declared source is diagnosed without being shut out.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * >
 * > - **Incremental**: each value is emitted as soon as its document is drawn, so the feed produced runs dry as the
 * >   feed drawn from does and an endless source is read as long as it is consumed.
 * > - **Materialising**: a document is held in memory while it is parsed, as parsing requires it as a single
 * >   contiguous string, so peak memory use is about twice the size of the largest document rather than of the feed.
 * > - **Stateless**: every document is parsed on its own, so the outcome is unaffected by how the feed is split
 * >   across nested feeds or runs.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * >
 * > A document that cannot be parsed is skipped and reported to the log, leaving the feed to run to completion.
 *
 * @typeParam V The type of the value produced; the parsed document is emitted as is, without being validated
 *              against it; defaults to a JSON {@link Object}
 *
 * @returns A task converting a feed of JSON documents, given as text or as responses, into a feed of values
 *
 * @throws {@link !Error Error} While the feed is consumed, whatever the source reports while producing documents, or
 *                              whatever reading the body of a response reports
 *
