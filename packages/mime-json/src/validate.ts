/**
 * Creates a value validation task.
 *
 * The generated task retains the values a validator accepts and drops the ones it reports violations for, so that a
 * consumer works on values already known to meet the constraints it expects.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * >
 * > - **Incremental**: each retained value is emitted as soon as it is drawn, so the feed produced runs dry as the feed
 * >   drawn from does and an endless source is read as long as it is consumed.
 * > - **Streaming**: values are validated one at a time and none held, so the length of the feed weighs on memory no
 * >   more than a single value does.
 * > - **Stateless**: every value is validated on its own, so the outcome is unaffected by how the feed is split across
 * >   nested feeds or runs.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * >
 * > A rejected value is dropped and reported to the log together with the trace listing every violation it incurs,
 * > leaving the feed to run to completion.
 *
 * @typeParam V The type of the validated values
 *
 * @param validator The validator applied to each value, reporting the trace of the violations the value incurs, or
 *                  nothing if it meets every constraint
 *
 * @returns A task retaining the values `validator` accepts
 *
 * @throws {@link !Error Error} While the feed is consumed, whatever the source reports while producing values, or
 *                             whatever `validator` reports while validating one
