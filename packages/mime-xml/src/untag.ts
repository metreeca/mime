/**
 * Creates a markdown renderer.
 *
 * The generated task converts a feed of parsed X/HTML trees into a feed of markdown text, one rendering per tree, so
 * that a consumer reading prose, a language model among them, works on text rather than on markup.
 *
 * A tree holding neither content nor a title nor a base URL is converted to an empty string, so that renderings stay
 * aligned with the trees they were drawn from.
 *
 * Where a tree states a title or a base URL, its rendering opens with a YAML frontmatter block stating them as `title`
 * and `url`, so that a consumer reads the page the text belongs to alongside the text itself. Each is written as a
 * quoted scalar, so that the punctuation a headline or a query string carries doesn't unsettle the block, and a field
 * is omitted where the tree states no value for it, so that nothing is guessed at.
 *
 * The title is the first `title` element a tree states outside the framing a reader is not after, so that the caption
 * of an embedded object is not mistaken for it; one carrying no text counts as none. The base URL is the one recorded
 * by the root of the tree, that is by the root element the tree is converted from or by the first one a document
 * holds; a base resolving to no absolute URL, as a relative reference standing on its own does, counts as none.
 *
 * Elements are rendered as follows, names matched as the tree carries them, case insensitively:
 *
 * - `h1`, `h2`, `h3` — a heading of the matching level, set off by a blank line, left out where it carries no text
 * - `p`, `section`, `article` — the content, set off by a blank line
 * - `div` — the content, set off by a blank line where the element states text of its own or wraps a lone element,
 *   whitespace aside, and closed by a line break otherwise, so that a field reads as a paragraph while the wrappers a
 *   page is laid out with don't split its content into blocks of their own
 * - `ul`, `ol` — a list set off from the surrounding content by a blank line, ordered lists marked as unordered ones
 * - `li` — an item marked with `-`, indented by two spaces for each enclosing list beyond the outermost, its content
 *   opening on the line the marker is written on, however the item lays it out, left out where it carries neither text
 *   nor an image
 * - `br` — a line break, two of them laying down the blank line a paragraph is often split with, a longer run
 *   saturating at that blank line and a run opening the text dropped
 * - `hr` — a thematic break, set off by a blank line
 * - `a` — a link to the `href` stated, labelled by the content, left out where it carries neither text nor an image
 * - `img` — an image reference to the `src` stated, labelled by the `alt` text
 * - `strong`, `b` — strong emphasis, the whitespace bordering the content written outside the markers, as markers
 *   padded with it read as text rather than as emphasis, left out where it carries no text, though the space it holds
 *   is kept
 * - `em`, `i` — emphasis, laid out as strong emphasis is
 * - `script` — a fenced `json` block, if the type is `application/ld+json`, set off by a blank line; nothing
 *   otherwise
 * - `head`, `title`, `style`, `noscript` — nothing, the title being stated by the frontmatter instead
 * - `nav`, `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `menu`, `menuitem`, `toolbar` — nothing, whatever they hold, so that the
 *   navigation, headers, footers and sidebars a page is framed by leave no text behind
 * - `form`, `input`, `button`, `select`, `textarea`, `label`, `fieldset`, `legend` — nothing, whatever they hold, so
 *   that the controls a page is operated through, the captions they carry among them, leave no text behind
 * - `iframe`, `embed`, `object`, `applet`, `canvas`, `svg`, `audio`, `video`, `track`, `source` — nothing, whatever
 *   they hold, so that the objects a page embeds leave no text behind
 *
 * Every other element contributes its content, the `html` and `body` a page is wrapped in among them, so that the
 * wrappers a page is built from leave no trace of their own. A link or an item is kept for the content a reader is
 * shown, the elements rendered as nothing counting for none of it, so that a decorative link leaves no empty label
 * behind. The text of a heading, of emphasis and of the frontmatter title likewise leaves them out, so that the
 * caption of a control or of a graphic doesn't reach the text through the prose enclosing it.
 *
 * > [!IMPORTANT]
 * >
 * > A page stating its content inside a form, as a filtered listing or a page-wide server-side form does, is thus
 * > rendered as the content outside the form alone, possibly as nothing at all. Where a page is laid out that way,
 * > select the region to convert with an {@link xpath} expression reaching inside the form, which {@link focus}
 * > leaves out as framing too.
 *
 * Character data is rendered with runs of spaces, control characters and typographic separators, the no-break space
 * among them, collapsed to a single space, whatever the markup lays out; a run bordering a text node is kept, so that
 * emphasis misplaced with respect to the surrounding spaces doesn't run words together. A comment carries no text but
 * counts as a space, so that the markers a framework leaves between elements keep the words on either side apart, as
 * do the fields a page lays out side by side. Text bordering an element runs into it as stated, so that a word split
 * across an element and the text beside it is not broken apart. A space never opens a line or closes a link label, so
 * that the whitespace a page is laid out with doesn't reach the text; leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from
 * each rendering.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * >
 * > - **Incremental**: each rendering is emitted as soon as its tree is drawn, so the feed produced runs dry as the
 * >   feed drawn from does and an endless source is read as long as it is consumed.
 * > - **Streaming**: trees are drawn one at a time and released as soon as their rendering is assembled, so the length
 * >   of the feed weighs on memory no more than a single tree does.
 * > - **Stateless**: every tree is converted on its own, so the outcome is unaffected by how the feed is split across
 * >   nested feeds or runs.
