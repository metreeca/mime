	/**
	 * Selects values.
	 *
	 * A single selection reaches across the whole target set: the values retrieved from each target are merged into one
	 * list, sparing the caller a loop of its own. Every axis, node test, predicate, operator and core function XPath
	 * 1.0 defines is available, each target taken in its turn as the context node.
	 *
	 * An expression computing a string, a number or a boolean, `count(//item)` among them, reports the value it
	 * computed for each target, so that whatever the language can express is reached the same way. A value an
	 * expression computed holds no tree of its own, and so selects nothing in its turn.
	 *
	 * Names are matched as the tree holds them, case sensitively, prefixes compared as written and no `xmlns`
	 * declaration read, so that a single set of expressions serves both the XML trees and the HTML ones, whose names
	 * are folded to lower case as they are parsed:
	 *
	 * - an unprefixed name test matches an unprefixed name alone, so `item` addresses `<item>` however the document
	 *   declares a default namespace, and leaves `<d:item>` out
	 * - a prefixed name test matches the prefix as written, so `d:b` addresses `<d:b>` whatever URI the document binds
	 *   `d` to, and nothing at all where the same element is written under another prefix
	 * - `local-name()` reports a name without its prefix and `name()` reports it whole, so `<d:b>` answers to
	 *   `local-name()='b'` and to `name()='d:b'` alike
	 * - `namespace-uri()` reports the prefix a name carries rather than the URI a declaration binds it to, as no
	 *   declaration is read; the `xml` prefix is the exception, bound by definition, so `@xml:base` and `lang()` read
	 *   what they are meant to
	 * - the `xmlns` declarations themselves are ordinary attributes, reported by an attribute step like any other
	 *
	 * The XML declaration and the document type declaration are not nodes, as the language prescribes, and a processing
	 * instruction is not one either, so `processing-instruction()` selects nothing; `namespace::` selects nothing in
	 * its turn, as no namespace node is held. A `CDATA` section is a text node holding what it wraps, rather than a
	 * node of its own.
	 *
	 * @param path The selection expression
	 *
	 * @returns An immutable list of the values selected by `path`, ordered by target and, within each target, in
	 *          document order, each node reported once; empty if `path` selects no value
	 *
	 * @throws {@link !SyntaxError SyntaxError} If `path` is malformed
